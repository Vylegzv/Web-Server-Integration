This is a SPRING.IO RESTful API HATEOS example, built using gradle, 
and a gradle wrapper. (So you don't need 'gradle' installed, hence 'gradlew')

--------------------

run [./gradlew tomcatRunWar] to build and start http server on localhost.
run [./gradlew test] to run the unit and integration tests.

Nice thing about this example code is 
1) has unit tests and real integration tests
2) command line build through gradle(gradlew wrapper)
